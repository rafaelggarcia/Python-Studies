My name is Rafael Garcia, I am 20 years old and I am a systems analysis and development student, 
here you will see my studies until I became a data engineer/python developer.

This repository refers to the Python course taught by Gustavo Guanabara, here will be all my exercises and classes in which I put into practice everything I learned during the course.

The course is very basic, but very extensive, it has improved my logic a lot, in addition to improving my ability to read code and understand syntax a lot.
